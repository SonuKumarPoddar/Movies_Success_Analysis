Movie Success & Profitability Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analytics study focused on understanding what makes movies successful and profitable. Using movie data, the analysis explores the relationship between budget, revenue, profit, ROI, genres, and director experience. The goal is to generate actionable business insights using Python and Power BI.
🎯 Problem Statement
Identify key factors that influence movie success and profitability to support data-driven production and investment decisions.
📂 Dataset
Source: TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset (Kaggle)
Files Used:
tmdb_5000_movies.csv
tmdb_5000_credits.csv
The dataset includes information on budgets, revenue, genres, directors, release dates, and other movie attributes.
🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
Power BI
DAX
Microsoft Excel
Jupyter Notebook
🔄 Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
Imported movie and credits datasets from Kaggle.
2. Data Cleaning
Removed invalid records (zero budget/revenue).
Handled missing values.
Fixed data types and formats.
3. Data Preprocessing
Created new columns such as profit and ROI (%).
Categorized movies into Flop, Hit, Super Hit, and Blockbuster.
Extracted primary genre and director information.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed budget vs revenue trends.
Studied ROI distribution.
Identified genre dominance and profitability patterns.
Evaluated director consistency using movie count and ROI.
5. Data Visualization
Built Python visualizations for trend analysis.
Designed interactive Power BI dashboards.
Created KPIs for total budget, revenue, profit, and ROI.
   #Key Insights
Overall ROI: ~198%
76% of movies belong to Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, and Animation.
Animation delivers the highest ROI despite fewer movies.
Action & Adventure generate the highest revenue.
Experienced directors (6–10 movies) show more consistent profitability.
📈 Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard highlights:
Genre-wise movie count, budget, revenue, and profit
Director-wise ROI and experience
Budget-friendly vs high-budget directors
KPI cards for financial performance
 #Conclusion
The analysis shows that movie success depends more on budget efficiency, genre selection, and director experience than on budget size alone. Combining Python-based analysis with Power BI visualization helps convert raw data into meaningful business insights.
